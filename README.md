# Web Templates

This repository has a basic Bootstrap 4 web template to get you started on your projects. You can "fork" this repository and then "clone" it to your computer. There, you can work on the project independently from this repository. 

After cloning it to your computer, make a copy of the example.html file to create your own index.html file. Make sure to commit to your own repository periodically to create save points along the way.
